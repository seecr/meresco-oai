from meresco.core.observable import Observable
from oairecordverb import OaiRecordVerb

class OaiGetRecord(OaiRecordVerb, Observable):
    """4.1 GetRecord
Summary and Usage Notes

This verb is used to retrieve an individual metadata record from a repository. Required arguments specify the identifier of the item from which the record is requested and the format of the metadata that should be included in the record. Depending on the level at which a repository tracks deletions, a header with a "deleted" value for the status attribute may be returned, in case the metadata format specified by the metadataPrefix is no longer available from the repository or from the specified item.

Arguments

    * identifier a required argument that specifies the unique identifier of the item in the repository from which the record must be disseminated.
    * metadataPrefix a required argument that specifies the metadataPrefix of the format that should be included in the metadata part of the returned record . A record should only be returned if the format specified by the metadataPrefix can be disseminated from the item identified by the value of the identifier argument. The metadata formats supported by a repository and for a particular record can be retrieved using the ListMetadataFormats request.

Error and Exception Conditions

    * badArgument - The request includes illegal arguments or is missing required arguments.
    * cannotDisseminateFormat - The value of the metadataPrefix argument is not supported by the item identified by the value of the identifier argument.
    * idDoesNotExist - The value of the identifier argument is unknown or illegal in this repository.

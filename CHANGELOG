CHANGELOG Meresco-Oai
=====================

version: 3.3 -> 3.3-Edurep-2
date:    2010-10-19

Use kwargs in OaiHarvester
--------------------------
OaiHarvester will now use keywordarguments to send calls to its observers.
(2010-10-19, 3.3-Edurep)

Oai Harvester state directory is created when absent
----------------------------------------------------
When the configured state directory (workingDir) does not exist yet it is now
created for you (including parent directories). The Oai Harvester now has the
same behaviour as similar meresco components which keep state in a configured
directory.
(2010-10-18, 3.3-Edurep)

==============================================================================

version: 3.2.1 -> 3.3
date:    2010-10-11

Save the OAI Harvester state.
-----------------------------
The OAI Harvester state (only the ResumptionToken) is saved in the workingdir of
the harvester. When restarting the resumptionToken will be read and the
harveseter will continue from the last state.
(2010-10-07, 3.2.1-Edurep)

Near realtime OAI + OaiHarvester component
------------------------------------------
OaiPmh (specifically OaiList) now supports the custom 'x-wait' parameter on
ListRecords verb that enables long polling for OAI updates over HTTP between
harvester and provider. The new OaiHarvester component enables non-blocking
harvesting from within a Meresco DNA server. It calls 'add' on an obeserver for
each ListRecords response and supports the 'x-wait' custom parameter.
(2010-10-06, 3.2.1-Edurep)

Oai ListRecords using yields
----------------------------
Oai ListRecords now uses yield statements instead of WebRequestServer-writes.
(2010-10-04, 3.2.1-Edurep)

==============================================================================

version: 3.2 -> 3.2.1
date:    2010-09-21

bugfix about in ListIdentifiers
-------------------------------
The output of the ListIdentifiers wrongfully contained Provenance statements. 
These have been removed in order to make the output compliant with the OAI-PMH
specification.

bugfix oai identifier in Identify
---------------------------------
The Oai Identifier in the Identify verb is matched against a regular expression
to make sure the identifier is valid according to OAI PMH specifications.

==============================================================================

version: 3.1.1 -> 3.2
date:    2010-09-20

!! Meresco-Oai 3.2 is not backwards compatible with Meresco-Oai 3.1.1

Consistant usage of args and kwargs in add calls
------------------------------------------------
The usage of args and kwargs with add calls has been normalized throughout
Meresco. Therefore the meresco-oai code has been made compliant with this new
practice.

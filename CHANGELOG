CHANGELOG Meresco-Oai
=====================

version: 3.1.1 -> 3.2
date:    2010-09-20

!! Meresco-Oai 3.2 is not backwards compatible with Meresco-Oai 3.1.1

Consistant usage of args and kwargs in add calls
------------------------------------------------
The usage of args and kwargs with add calls has been normalized throughout
Meresco. Therefore the meresco-oai code has been made compliant with this new
practice.
